# Detecting Breast Tissue Anomalies in Mammograms with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains the code which my colleague and I worked on to study the ability of convolutional neural networks to accurately detect anomalous tissue in mammograms. 

We processed, modelled, and drew inference using Python 3.6 and the packages Keras (built on Tensorflow), Sklearn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas.

Our data came from two open sources:

- M. Heath, K. Bowyer, D. Kopans, R. Moore, and W. P. Kegelmeyer. The digital database for screening mammography. In Proceedings of the 5th inter- national workshop on digital mammography, pages 212{218. Medical Physics Publishing.

- R. S. Lee, F. Gimenez, A. Hoogi, K. K. Miyake, M. Gorovoy, and D. L. Rubin. A curated mammography data set for use in computer-aided detection and diagnosis research. Scientific data, 4:170177, 2017. ISSN 2052-4463.
